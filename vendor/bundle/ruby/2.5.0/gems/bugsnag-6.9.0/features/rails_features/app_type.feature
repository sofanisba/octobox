Feature: App type configuration

Background:
  Given I set environment variable "MAZE_API_KEY" to "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
  And I set environment variable "APP_PATH" to "/usr/src"
  And I configure the bugsnag endpoint

Scenario Outline: Setting app_type in initializer works
  Given I set environment variable "RUBY_VERSION" to "<ruby_version>"
  And I set environment variable "MAZE_APP_TYPE" to "custom_app_type"
  And I start the service "rails<rails_version>"
  And I wait for the app to respond on port "6128<rails_version>"
  When I navigate to the route "/app_type/initializer" on port "6128<rails_version>"
  Then I should receive a request
  And the request is a valid for the error reporting API
  And the request used the Ruby notifier
  And the request contained the api key "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
  And the payload field "events" is an array with 1 element
  And the exception "errorClass" equals "RuntimeError"
  And the exception "message" starts with "handled string"
  And the event "metaData.request.url" ends with "/app_type/initializer"
  And the event "app.type" equals "custom_app_type"

  Examples:
    | ruby_version | rails_version |
    | 2.0          | 3             |
    | 2.1          | 3             |
    | 2.2          | 3             |
    | 2.2          | 4             |
    | 2.2          | 5             |
    | 2.3          | 3             |
    | 2.3          | 4             |
    | 2.3          | 5             |
    | 2.4          | 3             |
    | 2.4          | 5             |
    | 2.5          | 3             |
    | 2.5          | 5             |

Scenario Outline: Changing app_type after initializer works
  Given I set environment variable "RUBY_VERSION" to "<ruby_version>"
  And I start the service "rails<rails_version>"
  And I wait for the app to respond on port "6128<rails_version>"
  When I navigate to the route "/app_type/after?type=maze_after_initializer" on port "6128<rails_version>"
  Then I should receive a request
  And the request is a valid for the error reporting API
  And the request used the Ruby notifier
  And the request contained the api key "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
  And the payload field "events" is an array with 1 element
  And the exception "errorClass" equals "RuntimeError"
  And the exception "message" starts with "handled string"
  And the event "metaData.request.url" ends with "/app_type/after?type=maze_after_initializer"
  And the event "app.type" equals "maze_after_initializer"

  Examples:
    | ruby_version | rails_version |
    | 2.0          | 3             |
    | 2.1          | 3             |
    | 2.2          | 3             |
