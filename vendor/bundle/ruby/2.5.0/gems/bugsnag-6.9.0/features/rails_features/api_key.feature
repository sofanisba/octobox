Feature: API key

Background:
  Given I set environment variable "MAZE_API_KEY" to "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
  And I set environment variable "APP_PATH" to "/usr/src"
  And I configure the bugsnag endpoint

Scenario Outline: Setting api_key in environment variable works
  Given I set environment variable "RUBY_VERSION" to "<ruby_version>"
  And I set environment variable "BUGSNAG_API_KEY" to "b35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6ab"
  And I start the service "rails<rails_version>"
  And I wait for the app to respond on port "6128<rails_version>"
  When I navigate to the route "/api_key/environment" on port "6128<rails_version>"
  Then I should receive a request
  And the request is a valid for the error reporting API
  And the request used the Ruby notifier
  And the request contained the api key "b35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6ab"
  And the payload field "events" is an array with 1 element

  Examples:
    | ruby_version | rails_version |
    | 2.0          | 3             |
    | 2.1          | 3             |
    | 2.2          | 3             |
    | 2.2          | 4             |
    | 2.2          | 5             |
    | 2.3          | 3             |
    | 2.3          | 4             |
    | 2.3          | 5             |
    | 2.4          | 3             |
    | 2.4          | 5             |
    | 2.5          | 3             |
    | 2.5          | 5             |

 Scenario Outline: Changing api_key after initializer works
  Given I set environment variable "RUBY_VERSION" to "<ruby_version>"
  And I start the service "rails<rails_version>"
  And I wait for the app to respond on port "6128<rails_version>"
  When I navigate to the route "/api_key/changing?api_key=c35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6ac" on port "6128<rails_version>"
  Then I should receive a request
  And the request is a valid for the error reporting API
  And the request used the Ruby notifier
  And the request contained the api key "c35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6ac"
  And the payload field "events" is an array with 1 element
