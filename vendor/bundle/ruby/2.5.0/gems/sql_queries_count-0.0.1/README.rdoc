= SqlQueriesCount

== About

It's a rails plugin that adds number of SQL queries that were done during processing request to your log. So instead of:

    Completed 200 OK in 249ms (Views: 141.8ms | ActiveRecord: 9.6ms)

you will get:

    Completed 200 OK in 249ms (Views: 141.8ms | ActiveRecord: 9.6ms | SQL count: 9)

Works with rails 3.0 and above.

== Installation

Add in your Gemfile:

    gem 'sql_queries_count'

Consider including it in development group, if you want to keep your production logs intact.

== License

This project rocks and uses MIT-LICENSE.
