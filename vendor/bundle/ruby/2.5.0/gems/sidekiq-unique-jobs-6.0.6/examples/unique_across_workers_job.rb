# This class showcase a job that is considered unique disregarding any worker classes.
# Currently it will only be compared to other jobs that are disregarding worker classes.
# If one were to compare the unique keys generated against a job that doesn't have the
# worker class removed it won't work.
#
# The following specs cover this functionality:
